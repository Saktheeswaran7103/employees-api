# Employee Management API

Django REST API with JWT authentication

 CRUD operations
 
 filtering
 
 pagination
 
 and tests.

“The root URL redirects to the Django admin login page for administrative access.
All REST APIs are available under /api/ and are secured using JWT authentication.”

I also forgot to add Runtime robot with live link, so that it would be sleep after some more time.
